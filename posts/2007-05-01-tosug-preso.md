# Theme: Plone in New Zealand

Presenter: Tim Knapp

Date: May 1st, 7pm

I will discuss some of the reasons why one of the New Zealand Government departments chose Plone and will demonstrate the use of the following Plone development tools: [ArchGenXML](http://plone.org/products/archgenxml) and [Instancemanager](http://plone.org/products/instance-manager).

This is the same presentation that was given at the [Japan Zope Users Group](http://plone.org/events/community/japan-zope-user-group-meeting-zope-essentials-6) in April but will be presented in English.
