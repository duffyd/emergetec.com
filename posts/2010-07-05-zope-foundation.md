Many thanks to Jan Smith, Zope Foundation Vice Chairman and Vice President, who put me forward for membership to the Zope Foundation. This is in acknowledgment of my work in New Zealand organising [Kiwi PyCon](http://nz.pycon.org/) and Python-related meetups, and my Zope evangelism via my many presentations over the years. A list of current Zope Foundation members can be found on the [Zope Foundation website](http://foundation.zope.org/members/nominated_members).
