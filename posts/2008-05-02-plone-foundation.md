I was granted membership to the Plone Foundation.

Individuals are [granted membership](http://plone.org/foundation/membership/meritguidelines/) to the [Plone Foundation](http://plone.org/foundation/members) based on services rendered to the Plone community and is therefore an indicator of someone's participation in the Plone community. It is a real honour to be accepted into the foundation and I would like to personally thank the [membership committee](http://plone.org/foundation/committees/membership/) and the [Plone Foundation Board of Directors](http://plone.org/foundation/board) for granting me this privilege!
