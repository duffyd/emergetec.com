Zope Essentials is a regular event organised by the [Japan Zope Users Group](http://zope.jp/) and this month I'm privileged to present regarding the revolutionary theming technology, [Deliverance](http://deliverance.openplans.org/), on [Thursday August 6, 7pm](http://zope.jp/events/zopeessentials/7/zope-essentials-7). A special thanks to [Jay Hotta](http://www.cybertron.co.jp/) for organising the event and [ASCII MediaWorks](http://www.ascii.jp/) for hosting.
